# Speech Recognition and Classification

## Project Motivation: 
Speech detection is a critical research topic, with applications ranging from analyzing speech patterns to disease classifications for schizophrenia or Alzheimer patients. Our group will concentrate on how speech data may be utilized to analyze sentiment and understand emotions, gender, accents, and age groupings, as well as the disease classification in this research. We will employ data from a variety of sources, as well as voices with various accents and voice lines. By doing this, we can assure diversity in our data and increase model accuracy when we use neural network-based algorithms to model our data. This research will be used for further analysis for a degree of mental health degradation by voice as a pre-trained model as a final result.

## Project Plan:
The group will collect data from a variety of sources and create models for each category. The deep speech model will be utilized as a benchmark, and several transformers will be pre-trained from scratch and applied to increase model accuracy. As a final product, the team will create a graphical user interface (GUI) with two main components. Users can upload an audio file to the application as an mp3, WAV, WMA, etc and several models will analyze it to classify the speaker's emotions, accent, gender, and age. Another feature of the GUI determines whether the speaker has Parkinson disease and whether or not it is noticeable in their voice. Additionally, the audio file will be transcribed and the text will be color-coded for different types of emotions. Along with the project's development, more related data visualizations will be added to interpret the final output.
